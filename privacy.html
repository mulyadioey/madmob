							<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
							<p>There are many different ways you can use our services &mdash; to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better &mdash; to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we&rsquo;re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
							<h2>Our Privacy Policy explains:</h2>
							<ul>

When you do, we&rsquo;ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo.</p>
							<p>Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</p>
